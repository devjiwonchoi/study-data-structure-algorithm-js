"Explicitly write out the steps you need to take to solve the problem."

> This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details (e.g. language syntax) as well.

Basically break down no matter what, time running out, etc.

Write out the steps, pseudo code, comments, etc.
