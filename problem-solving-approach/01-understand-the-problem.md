# Understand the problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Summary

1. restate in own words
2. inputs, factors
3. outputs
4. enough info?
5. label important parts

## Even Shorter

1. restate
2. I/O
3. enough info?
4. what's important?
